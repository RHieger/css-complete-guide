        EXAMPLE OF EMBEDDED CSS:

        This method is sometimes used, though it is also not the most
        desirable for similar reasons to why inline CSS style is not
        advisable.

        While it is true that embedding puts CSS styles into a centralized
        location within the HTML file, making it a bit easier to maintain,
        it does NOT make the CSS rules available project-wide, meaning that
        the embedded CSS would need to be copied and pasted into multiple
        HTML documents, which is quite laborious.

        Also, it introduces the problem of which copy of the embedded CSS is
        authoratative? That is, when changes are introduced to the CSS code,
        which copy of it should be viewed as the most current?

    <!-- <style> element commented out in favor of external CSS file. -->
