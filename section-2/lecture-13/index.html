        <!-- EXAMPLE OF INLINE STYLING:
             
             This method of styling is not recommended as best practice. The
             reason is that as a project grows, inline styling becomes more
             and more difficult to maintain. It is very difficult to search
             out what might be bugs in CSS code.

             Further, suppose you want the styles to apply to more than the
             elements in whiich they have been inserted inline. It would then
             be necessary to copy and paste these styles into other sections
             of the same page, or, even worse, into completely different HTML
             documents.
